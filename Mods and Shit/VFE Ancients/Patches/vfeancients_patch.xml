            <description>The primary element in the Ancients’ project of developing super soldiers, the supergenetics pod is the result of many dubious experiments in order to take on the Mechanoids. Soldiers are expected to lie in the pod and are then injected with single-use nanomachines designed to augment their physiology.\n\nThis is the main module responsible for creating super soldiers, but to improve the quality, efficiency, and safety of the project, other equipment needs to be placed in the vicinity of the supergenetics pod.</description>

        <value>
            <description>A small element that links to the Supergenetics Pod that allows it to store and extract a dose of super-nanites, effectively shaving a day off of the process. No more than 10 can be linked as at least 5 days are needed for the patient to process and accept the transition.\n\nAn add-on to the supergenetics pod, this device needs to be placed in close proximity to it and will cut one day from the injection time.</description>

        <value>
            <description>An element designed to compare super-nanites to each other and remove weaker, competing strains from compromising the transition process. Ideally operating in pairs, each comparing two strains against each other and lowering the chances of side effects by 10% in total.\n\nAn add-on to the supergenetics pod, this device needs to be placed in close proximity to it and will cut reduce the chances of experiment failure by 5%.</description>

        <value>
            <description>An extension that was developed after several successful cases with the supergenetics Pod, the Genome Macrothermometer was designed to further enhance successful super-soldiers. The primary function is for it to help prevent a thermal runaway, or fiery meat explosion, from occurring by having the super-nanites only interact with parts of the genomes that weren’t altered on the first Transition Phases.\n\nAn add-on to the supergenetics pod, this device needs to be placed in close proximity to it and will allow unlocking an additional ability over the limit of 3.</description>

        <value>
            <description>Whilst regular supergene tailoring works by altering the genes as a whole, some scientists managed to create a work-around by instead creating small, isolated environments within which the alterations can occur independently. Thus, this machine is designed to insert partitions in the form of stabilised mucus that is completely non-reactive and doesn’t cause rejection in the patient’s body, becoming a permanent part of their genomes.\n\nAn add-on to the supergenetics pod, this device needs to be placed in close proximity to it and will allow unlocking an additional ability over the limit of 3.</description>
